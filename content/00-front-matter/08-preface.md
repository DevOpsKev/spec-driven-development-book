# Preface {.unnumbered}

Something fundamental is changing in how we build software, and it's moving fast.

In February 2026, Spotify's co-CEO told investors that the company's best developers hadn't written a single line of code since December. Engineers specify what they want in natural language from Slack on their phones, AI generates the implementation, and they review and merge before they reach the office. Spotify shipped over fifty new features in 2025 using this approach. At Anthropic, the head of Claude Code hasn't written code by hand in over two months — shipping dozens of pull requests a day, every one generated by AI. The tool is now substantially writing itself.

This isn't the future. It's the present. And most of us don't have a methodology for it.

AI coding tools have gone from curiosity to daily driver in the space of a couple of years. Most of us are still figuring out what works. We prompt, we iterate, we get something that mostly functions, and we move on. The industry has started calling it "vibe coding" — half joke, half admission that we're making it up as we go.

Specification Driven Development is an attempt to change that. The core idea is simple: instead of prompting and fixing, you write specifications. Instead of maintaining code, you maintain the specs that generate it. The specification becomes the artifact. Code becomes a side effect.

This isn't a contrarian position any more. It's what the industry's most advanced practitioners are converging on independently. Tessl raised $125 million on the thesis that software development should be "spec-centric, not code-centric." NVIDIA's Jensen Huang wants his 30,000 engineers to stop writing code entirely and focus on problem discovery. Anthropic has shifted hiring from language specialists to generalists, because — in their words — "the model can fill in the details." The pattern is the same everywhere: the specification is becoming the primary engineering contribution.

I'm writing this book now — early, incomplete, in the open — because this methodology is emerging in real time and I want to capture it while the lessons are fresh. SDD isn't mine to gatekeep. The ideas in this book draw on work happening across the industry, from Thoughtworks to Microsoft to Tessl to individual practitioners who are discovering the same patterns independently. The sooner we have a shared language and a shared set of practices, the sooner we all benefit.

My hope is that this book becomes a catalyst. A starting point for collaboration, not the final word. The repository is public. The specs are visible. The methodology is documented in the same repo that uses it. If you disagree with something, open an issue. If you've found a better pattern, contribute it. If you've hit a wall that SDD doesn't address, that's exactly the kind of problem I want to hear about.

These technologies are transformative. How we adapt to them matters — not just for individual productivity, but for the engineering community as a whole. I want us to handle this transition well. I want the practices we develop now to be ones we're proud of in five years.

I also just find the subject fascinating. I want to be in the thick of it with my sleeves rolled up, building things, breaking things, and writing down what I learn. If that sounds like your kind of project, you're welcome here.
